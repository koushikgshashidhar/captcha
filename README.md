Securing Spring Boot Application by Captcha Validation

A CAPTCHA is an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart“. It is a type of challenge–response test to determine whether the user is human or not. Basically Captcha is a kind of tool to differentiate between human users and automated users such as bots. Captcha provides an authorization test that is easy for a human being to perform. On the other hand it becomes relatively difficult to perform in a computer program. For example, recognizing elongated letters or numbers, or clicking on an area with a specific image.
